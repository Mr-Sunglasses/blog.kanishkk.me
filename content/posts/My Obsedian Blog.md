> People said I should accept the world. Bullshit! I don't accept the world. - Richard M. Stallman

## The Self-Hosting Manifesto

In a world of convenient cloud services and platform dependencies, we choose a different path:

### Our Principles

 1. **Independence:** We rely on our own Linux machines, not external platforms.
 2. **Skill Cultivation:** What others see as a "skill issue," we see as an opportunity for growth.
 3. **Time Investment:** We value long-term control over short-term convenience.

### Our Philosophy

> "Self-hosting isn't just about saving time;
> it's about owning our digital destiny."

### Our Toolbox

*  **Computer:** That can Run Linux
*  **Linux:** Our foundation
*  **Open-source software:** Our building blocks
*  **Curiosity:** Our most valuable asset

### Our Reward

Mastery over our digital environment, unmatched privacy, and the satisfaction of true ownership.
*Remember: Every service you self-host is a vote for digital sovereignty.*
